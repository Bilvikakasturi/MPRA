# MPRA
This projects a streamlined way to retrieve oligonucleotide sequences for massively parallel reporter assays

Input: lead SNP rsIDs

Upload file with list of lead SNPs (rsIDs)
Minor allele frequency cutoff
Select number of 1000 Genome super populations needed to make cutoff (of 5: EUR, AMR, SAS, EAS, AFR)
Select whether user wants 3â€™-UTR SNPs or Enhancer SNPs 
Screen validations are present if any of the above is not selected.


Output: list of oligonucleotide sequences for synthesis to test SNPs in an MPRA
